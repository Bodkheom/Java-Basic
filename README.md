Hi Readers,

I’m in the process of creating a README file for a folder that encompasses my entire journey of learning Java. This folder contains a comprehensive collection of questions, assignments, and other materials that have been part of my learning experience.

The README will offer a detailed overview of the contents, starting with a summary of the folder’s structure. It will outline the types of questions and assignments included, along with their purposes. I’ll also include brief descriptions of key learning objectives and challenges encountered along the way. This should provide clear guidance on navigating through the resources and understanding their relevance.

I aim to make it informative and easy to follow, helping anyone who explores the folder to grasp the context and significance of each item.

Best regards,
Om Bodkhe
